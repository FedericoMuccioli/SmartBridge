# SmartBridge ðŸŒ‰ ![StatusBadge](https://badgen.net/badge/Status/Completed/green)

___
## **PROJECT DESCRIPTION**
**This is an University project for the "Embedded Systems and Internet of Things" Exam.**

*This project is the second assignment out of three.*

***Smartbridge*** is an Arduino project where the aim was to create a **prototype of an intelligent bridge** that would automatically manage two distinct functions:

- *Water Level Monitoring & Emergency management.*
- *Automatic Pedestrian Lighting.*

The *Arduino program* is based on **synchronous Finite State Machines**, **task-based architectures** and **object-oriented programming**.

___
## **JAVA APPLICATION:**

This project also contains a very minimal **JAVA application** that show the user some *important data*:

- *Current Water Level*
- *Current Smart Lights Status*
- *Current Bridge Status*

The Application contains a **real-time graph** of the water level.

___
## **FEATURES:**

- Automatic Water Level Monitoring.
- Automatic change of bridge status.
- Automatic change of Valve degrees.
- Ability to switch the Valve manual control through hardware or software.
- Automatic Pedestrian Lights.

___
## **COMPATIBILITY:**

**The arduino program is based on Arduino UNO.**

*The JAVA application can be used with both **Windows** and **Mac** devices.*
___
